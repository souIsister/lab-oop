# Python Laboratory Projects

A collection of Python laboratory assignments from my Computer Science coursework at City College of Angeles.

## üêç Laboratory Projects

### Lab 1: Input/Output & String Formatting
**File:** `lab1.py`

Learn the fundamentals of Python I/O operations and string formatting techniques.

**Concepts Covered:**
- Print statements and ASCII art
- Basic input/output operations
- String formatting with f-strings and % specifiers
- Type casting (int, float)
- String manipulation

**Key Programs:**
1. ASCII art display (CODE text)
2. Database record formatting
3. Email template with user input
4. Social media post scheduling with formatted output
5. Type casting and arithmetic operations

**What It Does:**
The program takes user input and demonstrates various formatting techniques like ASCII art, f-strings, and the % operator. Then it performs type casting to show the difference between integers and floats.

### Lab 2: Loops & Nested Structures
**File:** `lab2.py`

Master control flow with loops and nested iterations.

**Concepts Covered:**
- For loops and while loops
- Nested loops
- Time module usage
- Loop control (range function)
- Time formatting

**Key Programs:**
1. **Countdown Timer** - Takes user input (time in seconds) and counts down, displaying hours:minutes:seconds format. Uses time.sleep() to create real-time countdown.
2. **Multiplication Table** - Generates a multiplication table based on user-specified rows and columns.

### Lab 3: List Operations & Menu System
**File:** `lab3.py`

Build interactive menu-driven applications using lists.

**Concepts Covered:**
- List manipulation (append, remove, sort)
- While loops with menu systems
- String searching and comparison
- List iteration
- Conditional logic

**Features:**
- Add games to a list
- Search for games in the list
- Remove games from the list
- View all games sorted alphabetically
- Exit program gracefully

**Menu-Driven Interface:**
- `1` - Add a game
- `2` - Search for a game
- `3` - Remove a game
- `4` - View all games (sorted)
- `0` - Exit

### Lab 4: Dictionary Operations & Shopping System
**File:** `lab4.py`

Work with dictionaries to create a simple shopping/ordering system.

**Concepts Covered:**
- Dictionary creation and iteration
- Dictionary lookups and retrieval
- List operations for order tracking
- Price calculations
- Formatted currency output

**Features:**
- Displays a menu of items with prices
- Allows user to add items to order
- Tracks order items and prices in separate lists
- Calculates and displays total cost
- User-friendly command-line interface

## üìù How These Labs Work

Each program is **interactive and command-line based**. Users run the program in their terminal/console and interact by typing inputs. For example:

- **Lab 1** asks for user input and displays formatted output
- **Lab 2** asks how many seconds for countdown, or rows/columns for the table
- **Lab 3** displays a menu and lets you add/search/remove games
- **Lab 4** shows a menu of items and lets you build an order

## üõ† Requirements

- Python 3.x
- No external libraries required (all use standard library)
- Run from command line/terminal

## üíª How to Use These Files

1. **Clone or download** the repository
2. **Navigate** to the project directory
3. **Run** any file using: `python filename.py`
4. **Follow** the on-screen prompts

## üìö Learning Outcomes

After working through these labs, you'll understand:
- ‚úÖ Basic Python syntax and data types
- ‚úÖ Input/output operations
- ‚úÖ String formatting techniques
- ‚úÖ Control flow structures (loops, conditionals)
- ‚úÖ Data structures (lists, dictionaries)
- ‚úÖ Menu-driven application design
- ‚úÖ User interaction and validation
